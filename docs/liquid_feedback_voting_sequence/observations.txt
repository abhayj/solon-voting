vote table contains the actual votes
=> this can be re-used for public votes. real secret votes are of course not stored anywhere.

battle table contains the pairwise rankings calculated from the votes
=> The external voting system will provide these results, they can be stored in this table
=> Somewhere is a stored procedure that calculates these results, it needs to be disabled with system setting

delegating_voter is written to when votes are counted. 
=> This information is not public now.
=> Also delegations have a public counterpart. This could again be reused. Otoh this can be confusing as it is not the same as actual delegations.
=> In any case, public delegations must never be counted as real votes towards any issue.
=> There could be a system where a member's weight is calculated from a few past *actual* delegations in each area. Even if we do not know who delegates to whom, we know the sum of delegated votes for each voting result. For instance, a member could be given the weight of geometric average of previous votes in each area.
=> Similar issues arise with delegating_*_snapshot tables

delegation
=> Not public info, but could be re-used for publicly signaled delegation.

direct_voter

initiative table contains various info about the voting result. Possibly this can remain as is - ie doesn't require info of actual votes.

There needs to be a new phase where public voting ends but private votes can still be cast
=> TABLE policy.public_voting_time and TYPE issue_state.public_voting_closed
